    <h1>⚠️Tracking Notice</h1>
    <p>DG Games has iframes (html tag) which allows for embedding websites into each other.
    <br>
    The CrazyGames iframes emit all sorts of tracking. 
    <br>
    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you get Bitdefender Anti-tracker and Malwarebytes Browser Guard before going to do some gaming here as when CrazyGames is connected, it connects to websites that sell your data online.

      Continue to DG Games (not one-time notice)
