A major AWS failure broke websites, apps, and services.
The issue came from a DNS failure in AWS's US-East-1 region.
Amazon said the AWS outage has been resolved, but i personally don't think it is fixed yet.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the backbone of a lot of the modern internet. Monday morning, at October 2025, AWS had a major failure, breaking tons of websites, apps, and online platforms on the World Wide Web. The bug came from Amazon's critical US-East-1 region, AWS's largest area.
As the outage spread, AWS's dashboard confirmed that 28 separate AWS services were impacted, causing big waits and timeouts across AWS cloud.
The AWS error temporarily snapped by the gauntlet of Big Purple Man from that one movie, wreaking havoc on major platforms such as Snapchat, Ring, Alexa, Wordle, Reddit, Roblox, Fortnite, Duolingo, and Hulu, as well as services like Coinbase, and Perplexity.
Even Amazon and Prime Video experienced outages. 
Data from the tool Downdetector, shows the boom of this morning's AWS outage.
In the first 2 hours, more than 1 million reports came from the US, followed by 400,000 from the UK.
By midmorning, total global reports had surged past 8.1 million, with 1.9 million from the US and 1 million from the UK. 
From Downdetector, around 1:30 PM to 2:50 PM is when the PEAK of the reports were put on to the website.
At 5:00 AM is when the first spike occurred.
They temporarily fixed it, but it crashed a little bigger and now there is a lot of work for people at Amazon to fix which kudos to the Amazon team for having to deal with this so all of which is to say, they're working on it, and things are progressing slowly but surely.
Most websites and apps that were experiencing disruption are working somewhat fine now and the issue is being slowly fixed, though there may be some delays.</p>
