Today Google has released Gemini 3.

It’s better than 2.5 and comes with thinking mode or fast mode, and you can do some vibe coding for some reason.

Google has begun the Gemini 3 era by releasing Gemini 3 Pro in preview, making it available today across Google products so you can use it to build and plan and just chat.

Gemini 3 Deep Think just thinks that one bit more, and they are giving access to safety testers before making it available to Google AI Ultra subscribers.

There is also Nano Banana integration which is from 2.5 but may receive upgrades.

Fast mode is great if you are feeling like it takes too long, but it may be dumber due to less parameters to run to cut down speed.

Fast mode is most likely 2.5.
