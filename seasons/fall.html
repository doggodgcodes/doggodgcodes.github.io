  <p>Autumn, also known as fall (in North American English), is one of the four temperate seasons on Earth. 
    Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). 
    Autumn is the season when the duration of daytime becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. 
    Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the winter solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). 
    One of its main features in temperate climates is the striking change in colour of the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.

  Popular activities during Halloween include trick-or-treating, attending Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling frightening stories, and watching horror or Halloween-themed films.
  Some Christians practice the observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead, although it is a fun, happy celebration for others.
  All Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this day, including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes.
  Some people also wear neon masks for halloween which is a much more recent type of costume, and they are kinda cool looking and putting on a robot voice makes it more "neon, i guess", idk.
  Oh, there is also times when people bring their phones to make silly halloween content for anyone to watch which is so fun to watch!
